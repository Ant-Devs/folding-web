<p>Hello! I'm Natalius Gabriel or Ant Devs.</p> &nbsp;
<p>I'm an indie game developer and I feel I will never be satisfied. And so I'm always trying to find ways to contribute to society.</p> &nbsp;
<p>Then I found about "Folding@home"</p>
<p>It's a project where anyone can donate their computing power which will be used for many great things.</p> &nbsp;
<p>I've donated computing power before through BOINC, but this is a bit different.</p> &nbsp;
<p>BOINC has multiple projects that you can choose from while Folding@home has predefined projects where you can join teams.</p> &nbsp;
<p>And so I set up a team.</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p>You can join my team by downloading the Folding@home client here:</p> &nbsp;
<a href="https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/"><p>Folding@home</p></a> &nbsp;
<p>Then entering 267489 as your team code after signup.</p>
